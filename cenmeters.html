            <h3>Centimeters </h3>
            <p>One centimeter is equal to one-hundredth (1/100) of a meter, which is defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in a 1/299,792,458 second time interval.

The centimeter, or centimetre, is a multiple of the meter, which is the SI base unit for length. In the metric system, "centi" is the prefix for 10-2. Centimeters can be abbreviated as cm; for example, 1 centimeter can be written as 1 cm.
